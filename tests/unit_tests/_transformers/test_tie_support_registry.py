"""Registry guardrail: every head-owning registered model declares a TieSupport policy.

``reject_unsupported_tie_word_embeddings`` defaults *undeclared* classes to
``TieSupport.BOTH``, so this test is the only enforcement that a newly onboarded
causal-LM / conditional-generation model cannot silently skip declaring
``tie_word_embeddings_support``. Every ``MODEL_ARCH_MAPPING`` class must either
declare a policy or be listed in the explicit, commented exemption below.
